* GUI Desktop Application Devolopment in Python

To develop the GUI desktop application in Python, it is recommended
to use [[https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter][~tkinter~]]. The installation instructions can be found [[https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html][here]].
To test whether the installation is done properly, check
[[https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html][/Verifying your Install/ section]]. Check /The Obligatory First Program/
section too.

A good starting point to learn some basics of tkinter library is to
consult the official [[https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/][/TkDocs tutorial/]].
The first example to examine can be found [[https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/firstexample.html][here]]. 

**Note:** Don't spend to much time focusing on tkinter library concepts.
The goal of this course is not to learn tkinter, but to use
it as a context for developing the core of the extensible application
that actually do something useful.
